Little Johnny grew up in a small village, surrounded by forests, cottages, and farms. Little Johnny has always been fascinated by the city, and dreams about living there every night.
As Johnny grew older, he acquired more and more money through his local job as a baker in order to finally go to the big city one day. Although he knew he would not save up enough money for another 10 years, he still was determined to go to the city and fulfill his dream.
One day, a mysterious man came into the bakery and walked straight up to Johnny instead of browsing the menu or the pastries. The mysterious man somehow knew Johnny's mission to get out of the small village, and offered to pay for the entire trip. However, there was a condition that came along with the free money.
